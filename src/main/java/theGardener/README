This is an example character template for the more experienced Slay the Spire modder.
It contains the basics of an empty character, as well as:
-an improved X cost framework action
-a card abstract filled with shortcuts (it will also automatically load beta art if you don't have art provided, to prevent crashes!)
-Strike and Defend examples of abstract
-a relic abstract that auto-loads images and defaults to a rock to prevent crashes
-empty relic example
-an extra damage variable and magicnumber variable (called Silly) for your cards!)
-TODOs in places you'll need to change stuff
